# K1MEANSK-Means Clustering from ScratchA clean, Pythonic implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using NumPy for efficient matrix computations and Matplotlib for data visualization.🚀 FeaturesCustom K-Means Class: Built without high-level ML libraries to demonstrate core algorithmic principles.K-Means++ Initialization: Implements a smart initialization strategy that spreads out initial centroids, leading to faster convergence and better results than basic random selection.Vectorized Distance Calculations: Uses NumPy broadcasting for high-speed Euclidean distance computation ($$d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum (p_i - q_i)^2}$$).Inertia Calculation: Computes the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to evaluate clustering quality.The Elbow Method: Includes a diagnostic script to determine the optimal number of clusters ($K$) for a given dataset.🛠️ How the Code WorksThe algorithm follows a four-step iterative process:Initialization: Depending on the init parameter, it selects $K$ starting points using either standard random selection or the K-Means++ probabilistic approach.Assignment: Every data point is assigned to its nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance.Update: Each centroid is recalculated as the mathematical mean of all points currently assigned to that cluster.Convergence: The process repeats until the centroids stop moving significantly (determined by the tol threshold) or the max_iters limit is reached.📊 Deliverables & VisualizationThe script generates synthetic data consisting of 300 samples across 4 distinct groups and produces two primary outputs:1. WCSS Output (The Elbow Method)The script prints the WCSS values for $K=1$ to $K=10$. By observing where the rate of decrease slows down significantly—the "elbow"—we can mathematically justify the choice of $K$.2. Final PlotLeft Plot: The Elbow Curve showing the relationship between $K$ and WCSS.Right Plot: A scatter plot of the final clustering result ($K=4$), highlighting the data points by color and the final centroid positions marked with a red X.📦 RequirementsTo run this code, you need the following Python libraries:numpymatplotlibscikit-learn (only for generating the synthetic make_blobs data)Would you like me to add a function to save the final plot as a PNG, or perhaps help you implement a "Predict" method for new, unseen data points?
